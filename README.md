Add it to your Discord server or user: https://modules-bot.ou-stem.club/add

OU Modules Bot is a project made for The Open University STEM Club's Discord. It's a Module Codes reference bot, useful in case you ever wonder what are the meanings of module codes which people mention. You can use it with the following types of commands:

 * `/oulookup MU123` - will display MU123's title, with a link.
 * `/oulookup MST124 MST125` - will display both MST124 and MST125 titles, with links.
 * `/oulookup mst121 !m263 !m366` - old modules and lowercase are fine too! However, we don't provide links to discontinued modules.
